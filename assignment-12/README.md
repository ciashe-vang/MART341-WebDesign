1.) Padding is the inner space between the content and the border of my box. Border is different because it is the perimeter of my image. Margin is the outer space with nothing around it, that is surrounding my image or content.
2.) I really enjoyed this week's assignment because I got to build onto my last week's page. This assignment went really well because I liked coding the drop boxes.
