It was difficult for me to learn how to do the borders. I don't know why it took me so long to understand the coding for it but it did! It was really interesting learning how on assignment-09 that the image links to another page. I thought it was really unique and cute. I am really starting to like doing the body elements. To me, it's just really fun experimenting with all the different colors.
