A directory is a location for storing files on your computer. It allows access to files because it contains only the information needed.
VCS are very helpful because it helps manage and track changes to documents and files. It also allows you to read your history to files.
My favorite artistic medium is Youtube. It's my favorite because people have so many unique ideas and spend the time to make it into an accessible format for everyone. I love watching either people make funny or informative videos on topics im interested in.
